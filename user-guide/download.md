## ANNOVAR main package

Please join the ANNOVAR mailing list at google groups [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/annovar) to receive announcements on software updates.

The latest version of ANNOVAR (2015Jun17) can be downloaded [here](http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/annovar_download_form.php) (registration required).

ANNOVAR is written in Perl and can be run as a standalone application on diverse hardware systems where standard Perl modules are installed.

## Additional databases

Many of the databases that ANNOVAR uses can be directly retrieved from UCSC Genome Browser Annotation Database by `-downdb` argument.

Several very commonly used annotation databases for human genomes are additionally provided below. In general, users can use `-downdb -webfrom annovar` in ANNOVAR directly to download these databases. To view of full list of databases (and their size and last changed date) prepared by ANNOVAR developers, use `avdblist` keyword in `-downdb` operation.

## User-contributed datasets

Several generous ANNOVAR users provide additional annotation datasets that may help other users. These datasets are described below:

* MitImpact2: pathogenicity predictions of human mitochondrial missense variants. This is prepared as filter-based annotation format and users can directly download from ANNOVAR (see table above).
* LoFtool score: gene loss-of-function score percentiles. The smaller the percentile, the most intolerant is the gene to functional variation. The file can be downloaded [here](http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/download/LoFtool_scores.txt.gz). Manuscript in preparation (please contact Dr. Joao Fadista - joao.fadista@med.lu.se). The authors would like to thank the Exome Aggregation Consortium and the groups that provided exome variant data for comparison. A full list of contributing groups can be found at http://exac.broadinstitute.org/about.

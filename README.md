# ANNOVAR Documentation

ANNOVAR is an efficient software tool to utilize update-to-date information to functionally annotate genetic variants detected from diverse genomes (including human genome hg18, hg19, hg38, as well as mouse, worm, fly, yeast and many others).

This is the GitHub repository for the documentation of the ANNOVAR software, described in this [paper](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/16/e164). Any edit to this repository will be reflected at ANNOVAR home page at http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org instantly.

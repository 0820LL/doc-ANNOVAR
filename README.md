# Documentation for the ANNOVAR software

ANNOVAR is an efficient software tool to utilize update-to-date information to functionally annotate genetic variants detected from diverse genomes (including human genome hg18, hg19, hg38, as well as mouse, worm, fly, yeast and many others).

This is the repository for the documentation of the ANNOVAR software, described in this [paper](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/16/e164). Any edit to this repository will be reflected at http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org instantly.
